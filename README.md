# Violence-Detection-in-automated-surveillance-using-CNN
As the world proceeds into the age of automation, the need of manual surveillance becomes increasingly question- able. This is not only due to excessive hours spent behind security monitors, but their continuous ineffectiveness from lapses of lack of concentration among other factors during manual surveillance. Thus, with the aid of Deep Learning and other acclaimed work related to real-time violence detection in surveillance, a conclusive study has led to proposed autonomous system using artificial intelligence. Hence this paper aims to highlight integration of a proposed Convolution Neural Network model that will not only detect violence but informatively alert authorities to the premise of intrusion. We employ what is referred to as a deep lightweight neural network called MobileNetV2. Preferred due to its unique architecture impressively designated for resource- constrained environments and devices, it is ideal for high per- formance requirement applications with minimal computational capabilities. The model acts as a feature extractor and classifier in training on various datasets. The model achieved the highest accuracy rate of 99% from one of a datasets.
